"""Stop hook: block the end of a turn that defers an AskUserQuestion to "next
message" via buttons but never arms the background timer that is supposed to
open that next turn.

Difficulty removed: the delivery-split rule (CLAUDE.md § Escalation —
"Long-artifact exception") requires that a long artifact or a turn that
already ran a tool deliver its `AskUserQuestion` on a FRESH turn, opened by a
`sleep 2` background timer's completion notification. CLAUDE.md states the
atomicity explicitly: "Arming the `sleep 2` timer and deferring the ask are
one atomic act — a prose promise to 'ask next turn' *without* the timer armed
in the **same** turn silently strands the ask, because no next turn ever
fires." That rule itself already covers the failure ("arm the timer"); it was
observed violated twice on 2026-07-09 anyway — the coordinator wrote the
deferral promise in prose but did not start the timer, so no next turn ever
opened and the promised ask never reached the user. This hook is the
structural backstop: it cannot un-strand the ask (the turn is already over by
the time Stop fires), but it makes the failure observable rather than silent.

Detection (current turn only — the slice of the transcript from the most
recent turn-boundary entry to the end; see lib.transcript_turns for the
boundary predicate). All three must hold to warn:
  1. The turn's assistant text contains a deferral-promise pattern (a small,
     tunable regex list below — RU+EN phrasings of "I'll ask via buttons next
     message").
  2. No timer was armed this turn: no backgrounded `Bash` tool_use whose
     command contains `sleep`, and no `ScheduleWakeup`/`CronCreate` tool_use.
  3. No `AskUserQuestion` tool_use was already emitted this turn (if the ask
     already fired, nothing was deferred).

Action: BLOCK — `{"decision": "block", "reason": ...}` on stdout, exit 0. An
earlier revision printed a plain warning and exited 0; that was a no-op. For a
Stop hook, exit-0 stdout is shown only to the human in transcript mode and
never reaches the model, so the guard could not constrain the actor it exists
to constrain. A block decision does reach the model and prevents the turn from
ending, giving it the chance to arm the timer or ask inline.

A blocking Stop hook can wedge a turn: the model may answer the block in prose
without calling a tool, in which case neither the `timer_armed` nor the
`ask_already_emitted` veto can ever fire and the block repeats forever. The
escalation is therefore bounded to ONE block per consecutive Stop streak — a
marker file under _DEFAULT_STATE_DIR (override with $ASK_DEFER_TIMER_STATE_DIR)
keyed by session id. The first blocking Stop creates the marker; the next Stop
for that session consumes it and stays silent, capping the worst case (a false
positive, or a stubborn model) at one extra turn.

Text that merely quotes or documents the promise phrasings — a code fence, an
inline code span, a blockquote — is stripped before matching, so working on
this hook does not trip it.

Any parse or filesystem failure fails open (silent, exit 0, no block): an
unreadable transcript, malformed stdin, or an unwritable state dir must never
wedge the workflow. Deterministic, offline, no network.
